## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Retell-native tool calling (not custom orchestrator): backend owns business logic, Retell handles voice
- pgvector over Pinecone: keeps stack simple, no extra service
- Per-client Google OAuth: each business owns their data, no shared credentials
- Claude Haiku for RAG: cost-efficient for retrieval + summarization on every call
- engine constructed at module import time in database.py; tests must override DATABASE_URL before importing or patch get_settings
- expire_on_commit=False on AsyncSessionLocal prevents lazy-load errors in async SQLAlchemy
- .env.example requires git add -f due to root .gitignore having .env.* wildcard

### Pending Todos
